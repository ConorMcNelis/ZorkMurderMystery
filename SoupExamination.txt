As you approach the soup you see that it's still hot. There's a spoon next to it but it hasn't been used yet. Whoever was planned to eat this didn't.
Upon smelling it you can tell it's a vegatable based homemade soup, either parsley or carrot. You consider tasting it to figure out, in case that piece of info could help you figure out who this was made for, but you decide against it because a seemingly innocent bowl of soup could perhaps be posioned...and the culprit may not want you to stay around for much longer.
