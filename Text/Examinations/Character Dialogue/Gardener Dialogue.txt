"Oh, you want to talk to me? What about?"
"Well, I had just finished trimming the courtyard hedges when I heard the scream. I ran into the house to find Mr Dead's body lying cold in the kitchen. I swear I didn't see anything else."
"He was fine, always a nice employer. I never had any issues with him. Well certainly not any issues substantial enough to...well...kill him over. There were some standard issues like not getting payed on time and some squabbles about holiday time but I never would've wanted this to happen..."
"Well, I'm the manor head gardener. I have a team of a couple other workers that I'm in charge of. He hired us personally because he doesn't like the big companies. I just need this gig for the money, he pays big and I have kids to put through college, that's pretty hard on a normal Gardener's salary."
"I don't know anything about that, sorry"
